## Talks & Notes
- **[04.10.2022] Some Calculations of Etale Cohomology**
  <br>
   In order to enhance understanding of etale cohomology, I calculated some cohomology groups as exercises and discussed a little bit on cohomology with coefficient $$\mathbb{Z}$$. [<a href="PDF-Personal Web/etale.pdf">Notes</a>]
- **[07.2022-08.2022] Algebraic Geometry**
  <br>
  During this summer holiday a friend and I organized an unofficial student seminar in which I gave several talks based on the second chapter of Hartshone's Algebraic Geometry. [<a href="PDF-Personal Web/ag-seminar-1-13.pdf">Notes 1</a>] [<a href="PDF-Personal Web/ag-seminar-14-29.pdf">Notes 2</a>]
- **[01.06.2022] Algebraic Cycles**
  <br>
  In a research seminar I gave a presentation on algebraic cycles by following some sections of Fulton's Intersection Theory. [<a href="PDF-Personal Web/algebraic cycles.pdf">Notes</a>]
- **[08.2020] Explicit Construction of the Intermediate Fields Between $$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$$ and $$\mathbb{Q}$$**
  <br>
  This note is based on the contents of Exponential Sums given by Prof. Daqing Wan in the summer school Mincourses on Number Theory hosted by Xiamen University. Literally speaking the note introduces the construcion of intermediate fields between $$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$$ and $$\mathbb{Q}$$ via exponential sums.

## Papers
- **Term paper supervised by Prof. Marat Rovinsky**
  <br>
  Smooth Representations of Totally Disconnected Locally Compact Groups [<a href="combinepdf.pdf">PDF</a>]
  <br>
  This paper discusses general theory of smooth representations, then forcuses on representations of $$\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$$ over local field $$F$$.
- **Bachelor thesis supervised by Dr. John Evans**
  <br>
  Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Applications [<a href="MA3PRO_report2020-21.pdf">PDF</a>]
  <br> This paper introduces representations theory of finite groups and applications on $$\mathrm{GL_2}(\mathbb{F}_{p^n})$$ for a prime $$p$$.
